		<h2><em>Description</em></h2>
		<p><em> This recipe is for the French toast that I like to make at home. It is high in protein and calories and is very filling</em></p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>4 eggs  </li>
			<li>1/2 tsp milk  </li>
			<li>Olive Oil  </li>
			<li>2 Slices of bread  </li>
			<li>3 tbsp brown sugar  </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
		
			<li>Crack the eggs into a rectangular container (it should be able to fit a piece of bread comfortably inside it) along with the milk and sugar (optional:  a pinch of salt to help the whisking process). Whisk until the mixture is consistent and there are no more lump. </li>
			<li>Place one piece of bread in the container and let it soak in the mixture for about five minutes. You can poke holes in it or press it with a fork to expedite the proces. </li>
			<li> Heat your pan  on low heat for 30 seconds </li>
			<li> Coat the pan with olive oil and let it heat up for another 30 seconds or so, until you can feel the heat above the pan.</li>
			<li> Gently scoop the soaked piece of bread out of the container, using a spatula, and place it on the pan.  </li>
			<li> Place the other slice of bread inside your container with the mixture and let it soak up whatever mixture is left in it. </li>
			<li> Let the bread on the pan cook for 1 minute before flipping it.  </li>
			<li>Keep repeating the previous step until the inside of the bread is fully cooked, i.e, the inside is no longer soggy. You can check this by prodding the middle with your spatula - if it give some resistance and is spongy then it is done.  </li>
			<li> Repeat the previous two steps for the other slice of bread.  </li>
			<li>(Optional) Place a tab of butter on your french toasts along with syrup of your choice </li>
