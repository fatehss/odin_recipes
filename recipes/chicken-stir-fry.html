		<h2><em>Description</em></h2>
		<p><em> This recipe is perfect for meal-prepping your high-protein chicken for the week as it is fast, clean, and requires the bare-minimum of ingredients.</em></p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 lbs frozen chicken breast  </li>
			<li>1 1/2 tbps olive oil  </li>
			<li>Teriyaki chicken sauce </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Defrost chicken in microwave for half the recommended time so that it is not completely frozen yet still firm </li>
			<li>Slice chicken into very thin pieces. Since the chicken is still partially frozen it should be easy to cut it evenly </li>
			<li>Heat your wok/skille on medium-high heat for 1 minute or until it gets noticeable hot </li>
			<li>Heat oil in the wok for 30 seconds </li>
			<li>Put the sliced chicken in the wok and immediately start stirring it with your spatula. You want to have each piece of chicken be heated in the center for around the same amount of time. Use the back of the spatula to move the chicken around and use the other side to scoop it intermittently (so that all sides of the pieces get cooked) </li>
			<li> After about one minute, pour a generous amount of the teriyaki sauce in the wok and continue stirring until there is no more pink chicken visible. </li>
			<li>Lower the heat to medium and continue cooking the chicken until the chicken is cooked your preferred amount</li>
		<li> Eat/store/season chicken as you see fit </li>
		</ol>
