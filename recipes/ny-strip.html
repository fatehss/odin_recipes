		<h2><em>Description</em></h2>
		<p><em> This recipe will show you how to make a delicious pan seared steak using a cast iron pan and an oven. It will take around 50 minutes from start to end (assuming your steak is already defrosted - I've forgotten mine in the freezer several times!)</em></p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 12 oz New York Strip </li>
			<li> 1 tsp butter </li>
			<li> 1 tsp salt </li>
			<li> Ground pepper </li>
			<li> Cooking oil spray </li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li> Pre-heat oven to 500F </li>
			<li> Leave the steak at room temperature for 30 minutes</li>
			<li> Rub the steak with the salt and pepper </li>
			<li> Heat the cast iron skillet on a high heat and apply a thin coating of cooking oil spray </li>
			<li> Sear the steak on either side until golden-brown (around 90 seconds either side). Make sure to also sear the edges of the steak for around 30 seconds each using tongs.</li>
			<li> Place the steak in a foil lined tray and put the tray into the oven </li>
			<li> Leave the steak in the oven until your meat thermometer reads the inner temperature as 130F. This usually takes around 5-7 minutes depending on the thickness of your steak </li>
			<li> Take the steak out of the oven and let it rest for around 5 minutes </li>
			<li> Place the butter on the top of the steak and enjoy! </li>
